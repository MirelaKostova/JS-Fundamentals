### :black_medium_small_square: Negative or Positive Numbers

Write a function that processes the elements in an array one by one and produces a new array.
Prepend each negative element at the front of the array (as the first element) and append each positive (or 0) element at the end of the array.
The input comes as an array of string elements holding numbers.
The output is printed on the console, each element on a new line.

### :black_medium_small_square: First and Last K Numbers
Write a function that prints the first k and the last k elements from an array of numbers.

The input comes as an array of number elements. 
The first element represents the number k, all other elements are from the array that needs to be processed.
The output is printed on the console on two lines. On the first line, print the first k elements, 
separated by space. On the second line, print the last k elements, separated by space.

### :black_medium_small_square: Process Odd Numbers

You are given an array of numbers. Write a function that prints the elements at odd positions from the array, doubled and in reverse order.
The input comes as an array of number elements.
The output is printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.

### :black_medium_small_square: List of Products

You will receive an array of products. Print a numbered array of all the products ordered by name.

### :black_medium_small_square: Array Manipulations

Write a function that manipulates an array of numbers.
路 Add {number}: add a number to the end of the array
路 Remove {number}: remove all occurrences of a particular number from the array
路 RemoveAt {index}: removes number at a given index
路 Insert {number} {index}: inserts a number at a given index

Note: All the indices will be valid!
The input comes as an array of strings. The first element will be a string containing the array to manipulate. Every other command you receive will also be a string.
The output is the manipulated array printed on the console on a single line, separated by space.
