### :black_medium_small_square:	Town Info
You will be given 3 parameters. The first parameter will be the name of the town (string), the second – the population (number), and the third the area (number). Print the result in the following format:
    "Town {town name} has population of {population} and area {area} square km."

### :black_medium_small_square:	Reversed Chars
Write a program that takes 3 parameters (characters) and prints them in reversed order with a space between them.

### :black_medium_small_square:	Lower or Upper
Write a function that prints whether a given character is upper-case or lower-case.

### :black_medium_small_square:	*Calculator
Write a function that receives 3 parameters: a number, an operator (string), and another number.
The operator can be:  '+', '-', '/', '*'. Print the result of the calculation on the console formatted to the second decimal point.

### :black_medium_small_square:	*Gladiator Expenses
As a gladiator, Peter has to repair his broken equipment when he loses a fight. His equipment consists of a helmet, sword, shield, and armor. You will receive Peter`s lost fights count. 
•	Every second lost game, his helmet is broken.
•	Every third lost game, his sword is broken.
•	When both his sword and helmet are broken in the same lost fight, his shield also breaks.
•	Every second time, when his shield brakes, his armor also needs to be repaired. 
You will receive the price of each item in his equipment. Calculate his expenses for the year for renewing his equipment. 
Input / Constraints
You will receive 5 parameters to your function:
•	The first parameter - lost fights count - is an integer in the range [0, 1000].
•	The second parameter - helmet price - is the floating-point number in the range [0, 1000]. 
•	The third parameter - sword price - is the floating-point number in the range [0, 1000]. 
•	The fourth parameter - shield price - is the floating-point number in the range [0, 1000]. 
•	The fifth parameter - armor price - is the floating-point number in the range [0, 1000]. 
Output
•	As output you must print Peter`s total expenses for new equipment rounded to the second decimal point: "Gladiator expenses: {expenses} aureus"
•	Allowed working time / memory: 100ms / 16MB.

### :black_medium_small_square:	*Spice Must Flow
Spice is Love, Spice is Life. And most importantly, Spice must flow. It must be extracted from the scorching sands of Arrakis, under the constant threat of giant sandworms. To make the work as efficient as possible, the Duke has tasked you with the creation of management software. 
Write a program that calculates the total amount of spice that can be extracted from a source. The source has a starting yield, which indicates how much spice can be mined on the first day. After it has been mined for a day, the yield drops by 10, meaning on the second day it’ll produce 10 less spice than on the first, on the third day 10 less than on the second, and so on (see examples). A source is considered profitable only while its yield is at least 100 – when less than 100 spices are expected in a day, abandon the source. 
The mining crew consumes 26 spices every day at the end of their shift and an additional 26 after the mine has been exhausted. Note that the workers cannot consume more spice than there is in storage. 
When the operation is complete, print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and the total amount of spice extracted. 
Input 
You will receive a number, representing the starting yield of the source. 
Output 
Print on the console on two separate lines how many days the mine has operated and the total amount of spice extracted.
 Constraints 
•	The starting yield will be a number within range [0…228].
